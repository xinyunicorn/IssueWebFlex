          <p>Food insecurity is one of the world's greatest issues right now and largely associated with the global food crisis. Hundreds of millions of people around the world are faced with hunger and thirst, having little to no access to nutritious meals or clean water. This issue is particularly prominent in low-income communities where the government provides insufficient funds or support to assist the people living there. It is ultimately up to nonprofit organizations and ordinary citizens like us to use our privileges to give what we can to help the vulnerable get back on their feet. </p>
